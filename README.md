# HVACorHVDC

Working technoeconomic paper exploring circumstances where buried HVDC cable is preferred to overhead HVAC from two perspectives: a developer's net present value (NPV) and a general levelized cost of energy (LCOE) perspective.

This first figure, for example, exlores the better of buried HVDC or overhead HVAC by levelized cost of energy assuming a 75km project connecting to a 1 GW farm in the US Midwest. The left and middle plots explore what choices of capacity and resulting LCOE are optimal for each transmission type given costs and delivered energy. The right plot compares LCOE between the two cases. 

The second figure offers the same comparison, but looking at the net present value of projects.
