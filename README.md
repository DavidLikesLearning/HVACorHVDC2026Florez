Working technoeconomic paper exploring circumstances where buried HVDC cable is preferred to overhead HVAC from two perspectives: a developer's net present value (NPV) and a general levelized cost of energy (LCOE) perspective.

This figure, for example, exlores the better of buried HVDC or overhead HVAC by LCOE assuming a 75km project connecting to a 1 GW farm in the US Midwest.
