,,,,,,,,,
^a: Transmittable power is derived from the cross-section of the cable according to [16].,,,,,,,,,
^b: The proposed non-linear model is used to create cost data for the respective transmissible power. A voltage level of 320 kV is assumed.,,,,,,,,,
^c: The provided cost parameters already fit the cost model coefficients.,,,,,,,,,
^d: Personal contact to the author revealed that the fixed cable cost are annuitised as well. A discount rate of 5% p.a. is specified in the source and a service life of 20 a is assumed to convert annuities to investment costs.,,,,,,,,,
^e: The cost for the land cable section is deducted from total cable cost.,,,,,,,,,
^f: The cost figures are the average of all given HVDC extruded offshore cable options ,aluminum and copper conductor,,,,,,,,
"^g: The provided source only relies on a single branch option. Given the purpose of this review, after thorough consideration of different options, the branch option's cost have been equally distributed to the B_{lp} and B_l parameters.",,,,,,,,,
